==================
How to Load Files
==================
 
NOTE:  Tested with the latest github version of HOL Light.

------
STEPS
------

  1. Go to the HOL Light directory

  2. Launch ocaml

  3. Type in:

    > #use "hol.ml";;
      

  4. Copy the contents of the SOURCE directory to HOL Light top directory.


  5. And finally load the top file:

    > needs "APPLICATIONS.ml";;
 	or just
    > needs "tactics_2.ml";;
    
    (This will also load all the intermediate files including 
	the gates library and the decision procedure)
